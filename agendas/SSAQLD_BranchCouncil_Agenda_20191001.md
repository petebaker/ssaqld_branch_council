## Specific discussion points

December: Miranda would also like everyone to think of a pub/bar/café
option for the December Networking meeting.

- Maybe South bank or the City ? She would like to suggest we go
  somewhere where we can get a small area set aside for us (Private
  function) and we pay for some qplatters, and buy our own drinks ?
- Or get a few jugs of beer ??
- Encourage it to be a members only event?
- Comments, ideas for the Tuesday meeting please?

YS Scholarships: Laura would like us to discuss

- Aminath claimed $220 for non student registration
- Farzana claimed $100 for student registration, $20 for the
  conference dinner and $140 for the communicating with R markdown
  course – total $260
- We consider capping the scholarship and offering both $220 the best
  option. Although we did not technically agree to support the course
  and dinner however they had signed up to these as an early bird
  before knowing they would receive support which is worth
  encouraging.

## Upcoming meetings
