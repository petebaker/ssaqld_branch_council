## Any Other Business

Brief discussion about merits of Dropbox and Google Docs as alternative to Github which is seen as too techie. We have used both in the past but Dropbox has introduced limit of three devices (which is fine until you update a current device)/PC) and exorbitant pricing. Further discussion needed.
