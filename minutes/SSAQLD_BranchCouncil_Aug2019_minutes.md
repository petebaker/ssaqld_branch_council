# Minutes: SSA QLD Branch Council 29 Aug 2019

### Attendees: Miranda, Adrian, Carmen, Laura, Peter

### Apologies: Dimitrios, Lee, Mingzhu

Meeting commenced at 4:37pm

## Previous minutes

Accepted unanimously (Proposed: Peter, Seconded: Carmen)

## Reports

President: Miranda noted that member numbers are strong. Noting that Central Council meets on 22 Aug (2 days time) she asked for topics that need to be discussed with Central Council. Combining Meetup Accounts to reduce costs with other states was discussed – currently about USD$250/year per account. Adrian noted that other branches are discussing these options and Central Council is aware of this issue. Peter thinks that each meetup account allows up to 3 meetup groups but is not sure of the process, potentially possible to change ‘owners’ of group but not sure and will investigate.

Treasurer: Laura reported that handover is proceeding. The last hurdle with changing signatories is to provide minutes of last Branch Council Meeting to bank. These are the AGM minutes. This is in hand and should be finalised soon.

Secretary: 

Web: Adrian noted that new SSA web site and ANZSTAT replacement is going smoothly.

Newsletter:

Young Stats Event: Very successful. Early speakers went over time so suggest a stronger chair for next event.

Upcoming Meetings: 

* YS 2019 Conference: discussed possibility of providing Registration fees for event for eligible young statisticians who are currently a member of the Qld Branch and are either presenting a poster or talk at YS 2019. Carmen will draft and send out/tweet request for applications.

* ASCNZ 2020 conference: (scholarships, support etc) Postponed until next Branch meeting

## Any Other Business

Adrian suggested Branch should put meeting notices, minutes etc on github.com for collaboration. Adrian will provide details
